The following repo contains the code for Course Project AS5401: Data Driven Modelling of complex fluid flow and aerospace systems. 

For code implementation - 
1. Download the dataset for running the code from - https://www.nwtf.ac.uk/dataset/1709/
2. Any instantaneous 2D PIV dataset will work for the code; each dataset represents a different plane, therefore, results may vary.
3. Place the dataset (.csv file) and code in the same folder, and change the filename in the first line of the code.
